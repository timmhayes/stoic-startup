  <h1>Stoic Startup Privacy Statement</h1>
  <p>This privacy statement applies to the treatment of personally identifiable information submitted by, or otherwise obtained
    from, you in connection with the associated application (“Stoic Startup”). By using or otherwise accessing the application,
    you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this privacy statement. </p>
  <h2>What personal information does Stoic Startup collect?</h2>
  <p>None really. As you can see on the Stoic Startup GitHub page (<a href="https://github.com/timmhayes/stoic-startup">https://github.com/timmhayes/stoic-startup</a>), this app is nothing more than a single html page with a bunch of great
    quotes about Stoicism. It doesn’t ask your name, collect any personal information of any kind, or even maintain a database
    to store anything about you. </p>
  <h2>Why do you have a privacy policy then?</h2>
  <p>Good question. We wanted to create a simple Facebook link so people could share their favorite quotes easily. And for that,
    we needed to create a Facebook app that, in turn, required this policy.</p>
  <h2>What about 3rd party sites?</h2>
  <p>As part of the Facebook share feature, this site links to the
    <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript">
      Facebook SDK for JavaScript</a>. And while Stoic Startup does not gather or store any personal information <i>from</i> Facebook, this integration
      makes it possible for Facebook to track your usage of this site. Any personal information you provide to Facebook would be subject
      to the terms of their privacy policy.</p>
  <h2>Questions or Concerns </h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy on the Stoic Startup, please contact the us at the GitHub repository
    listed above. </p>
